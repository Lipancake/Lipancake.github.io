## Q4: Largest Factor
Write a function that takes an integer n that is greater than 1 and returns the largest integer that is smaller than n and evenly divides n.

::: info Hint
Hint: To check if b evenly divides a, you can use the expression a % b == 0, which can be read as, "the remainder of dividing a by b is 0."

## Q5: If Function vs Statement
Let's try to write a function that does the same thing as an if statement.

Hint: If you are having a hard time identifying how an if statement and if_function differ, consider the rules of evaluation for if statements and call expressions.

## Q6: Hailstone
Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

Pick a positive integer n as the start.
If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
Continue this process until n is 1.
The number n will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

::: info Hint
Breaking News (or at least the closest thing to that in math). There was a recent development in the hailstone conjecture last year that shows that almost all numbers will eventually get to 1 if you repeat this process. This isn't a complete proof but a major breakthrough.
:::

This sequence of values of n is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name n, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at n, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:
